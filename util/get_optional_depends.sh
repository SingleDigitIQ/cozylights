# This script is naive: does not try to find mod.conf recursevily, so it sometimes can miss something,
# and also it can add something unrelated, that is just some logic for light_sources and not a nodedef,
# and probably some ancient mod' file extension won't be picked up if it's a thing, aside from gorillions of
# other problems. Does enough so far
